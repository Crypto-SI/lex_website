# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on modernizing and fixing critical issues in the existing Next.js website. The modernization addresses Chakra UI v3 implementation problems, performance issues, accessibility concerns, code quality improvements, and overall maintainability. The goal is to transform the current codebase into a production-ready, scalable, and maintainable application following modern web development best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Chakra UI v3 Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Chakra UI v3 implementation so that the application uses modern styling patterns and maintains consistency across components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL use proper Chakra UI v3 configuration instead of defaultSystem
2. WHEN custom themes are defined THEN the system SHALL properly integrate the theme from src/theme.ts
3. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use consistent Chakra tokens instead of mixing CSS variables
4. WHEN rendering components THEN the system SHALL follow Chakra UI v3 best practices for theming and styling

### Requirement 2: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast page loading and smooth interactions so that I have an optimal browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the homepage loads THEN the system SHALL optimize video loading with proper compression and lazy loading
2. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL use Next.js Image component with proper optimization
3. WHEN external scripts are needed THEN the system SHALL load them on-demand rather than globally
4. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading for non-critical components
5. WHEN media files load THEN the system SHALL provide fallbacks for failed loads

### Requirement 3: Accessibility Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with disabilities, I want accessible web content so that I can navigate and interact with the website effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate alt text for all images
2. WHEN text is rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain proper color contrast ratios
3. WHEN interactive elements are present THEN the system SHALL support keyboard navigation
4. WHEN animations occur THEN the system SHALL ensure they are keyboard accessible
5. WHEN focus changes THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual focus indicators

### Requirement 4: Code Quality and Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable code so that the application is easy to understand, modify, and scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN client components are used THEN the system SHALL properly handle SSR with appropriate 'use client' directives
2. WHEN state management is needed THEN the system SHALL use consistent patterns for client-side state
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper error boundaries
4. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use a consistent design system approach
5. WHEN TypeScript is used THEN the system SHALL have proper type definitions for all props and data

### Requirement 5: Content Management and Scalability

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want flexible content management so that I can update website content without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content needs updating THEN the system SHALL separate content from components using a data layer
2. WHEN different languages are needed THEN the system SHALL support internationalization
3. WHEN pricing or availability changes THEN the system SHALL use configurable data instead of hard-coded values
4. WHEN content structure changes THEN the system SHALL maintain semantic HTML structure

### Requirement 6: SEO and Metadata Optimization

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want good search engine visibility so that potential customers can find our website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN the system SHALL provide complete and accurate metadata
2. WHEN search engines crawl THEN the system SHALL include structured data for business information
3. WHEN the site is indexed THEN the system SHALL provide proper sitemap and robots.txt
4. WHEN content is rendered THEN the system SHALL use semantic HTML structure for better SEO

### Requirement 7: Security and Best Practices

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure interactions so that my data and privacy are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external scripts load THEN the system SHALL include integrity checks
2. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL implement CSRF protection
3. WHEN user input is processed THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all data
4. WHEN rate limiting is needed THEN the system SHALL implement proper throttling for forms

### Requirement 8: Build and Deployment Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable builds and deployments so that the application can be maintained and deployed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is built THEN the system SHALL address all TypeScript and ESLint errors
2. WHEN environment variables are used THEN the system SHALL have proper configuration management
3. WHEN Docker is used THEN the system SHALL optimize container builds for production
4. WHEN builds fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and prevent deployment
